## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you have:
- Git installed on your machine
- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Composer
- A GitLab, GitHub, or other Git hosting account

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork the repository (see [Forking and Contributing](#forking-and-contributing))
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install dependencies: `composer install`
4. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
5. Make your changes
6. Test your changes
7. Push to your fork
8. Create a merge/pull request

## Issue Templates

When creating an issue, you'll be prompted to choose a template. We have several templates to help you provide the right information:

### Bug Report Template

Use this template when you've found a bug. It will ask for:
- **Expected behavior** - What should happen
- **Current behavior** - What actually happens
- **Steps to reproduce** - How to recreate the bug
- **Environment** - Your OS, browser, PHP version, project version
- **Screenshots** - If applicable

The template automatically applies these labels:
- `Type::Bug`
- `Status::Backlog`

**You should also add:**
- `Priority::*` (Critical, High, Medium, or Low) if urgent
- `Area::*` (Frontend, Backend, etc.) for the affected area

### Feature Request Template

Use this when suggesting new functionality. It will ask for:
- **Problem statement** - What problem does this solve?
- **Proposed solution** - What would you like to happen?
- **Alternatives considered** - Other solutions you've thought about
- **Use cases** - How would this be used?

The template automatically applies:
- `Type::Feature`
- `Status::Backlog`

### Enhancement Template

Use this for improvements to existing features. It will ask for:
- **Current behavior** - How it works now
- **Proposed improvement** - How to make it better
- **Benefits** - Why this improvement is valuable
- **Backwards compatibility** - Will this break anything?

The template automatically applies:
- `Type::Enhancement`
- `Status::Backlog`

### Task Template

Use this for general tasks that don't fit other categories. It will ask for:
- **Task description** - What needs to be done
- **Acceptance criteria** - How we know it's complete
- **Context** - Why this is needed

The template automatically applies:
- `Status::Backlog`

### Submitting Your Issue

After filling out the template:
1. Review your issue for completeness
2. The labels will be applied automatically
3. Add any additional labels if needed (Priority, Area)
4. Submit the issue
5. A maintainer will review and triage it

**Note:** Issues are initially added to the "Future Release" milestone until they're scheduled for a specific version.

## Branching Strategy

We use GitLab Flow with release branches. Here's how it works:

### Main Branches

- **`main`** - Latest stable release
  - All releases are tagged from main
  - Protected: No direct pushes allowed
  
- **`release/X.Y.x`** - Long-term support branches for patch releases
  - Example: `release/1.0.x` for v1.0.1, v1.0.2, etc.
  - Created when needed for patches

### Feature Branches

When contributing, create a feature branch:

**Format:** `feature/short-description` or `fix/short-description`

**Examples:**
- `feature/add-dark-mode`
- `fix/navigation-bug`
- `feature/issue-123-user-profiles`

### Creating Your Branch

```bash
# For new features
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# For bug fixes
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix
```

### Workflow

1. **Create branch** from `main`
2. **Make changes** and commit
3. **Push** to your fork
4. **Create MR** to `main` branch
5. **Wait for review** from maintainer
6. **Address feedback** if needed
7. **Maintainer merges** when approved

**Important:** Always create your branch from `main` and target `main` in your merge request.

## Merge Request Process

### Before Creating a Merge Request

1. **Ensure there isn't an existing MR** for the same change
2. **Create or link to an issue** - All MRs should reference an issue
3. **Test your changes** locally
4. **Run code linting** - Follow the naming conventions
5. **Update documentation** if needed

### Creating Your Merge Request

We have templates for different types of merge requests:

#### Default Template (Bug Fixes, Features, Enhancements, Tasks)

Use this for most MRs. It includes:
- Description of changes
- Type of change (Bug fix, Feature, Enhancement, etc.)
- Testing performed
- **Accessibility tests** (required for all UI changes)
- Tests added
- Documentation updates
- Pre-submission checklist

The template automatically applies:
- `Status::In Review`

**You should also add:**
- `Type::*` (Bug, Feature, Enhancement, etc.)
- `Area::*` (Frontend, Backend, etc.)

#### Release Template (Maintainers Only)

This template is for release merge requests and should only be used by maintainers.

### Merge Request Guidelines

**For External Contributors:**
1. Create your MR using the Default template
2. Fill out all sections completely
3. Link to the related issue: `Closes #123`
4. Wait for maintainer review
5. Address any feedback promptly
6. A maintainer will approve and merge your MR

**Note:** All MRs require maintainer approval. External contributors cannot merge their own MRs.

### Code Review Process

When you submit an MR:
1. A maintainer will review within 1-3 days
2. They may request changes or ask questions
3. Address feedback by pushing new commits
4. Once approved, the maintainer will merge
5. Your branch will be automatically deleted

### After Your MR is Merged

- Your changes will be included in the next release
- The related issue will automatically close
- You'll be credited in the release notes
- Thank you for contributing! 🎉

## Label System

We use a comprehensive label system to organize issues and merge requests:

### Status Labels (Workflow)

Labels that track where an issue/MR is in the workflow:
- `Status::Backlog` - Not yet prioritized
- `Status::To Do` - Ready to work on
- `Status::In Progress` - Currently being worked on
- `Status::In Review` - Under code review
- `Status::Approved` - Approved and ready to merge
- `Status::Blocked` - Cannot proceed (explain in comments)
- `Status::On Hold` - Paused temporarily

### Type Labels (What It Is)

Labels that categorize the work:
- `Type::Bug` - Something isn't working
- `Type::Feature` - New functionality
- `Type::Enhancement` - Improvement to existing feature
- `Type::Documentation` - Documentation updates
- `Type::Refactor` - Code improvement without behavior change
- `Type::Security` - Security-related changes
- `Type::Performance` - Performance improvements
- `Type::Experimental` - Experimental features

### Priority Labels (Urgency)

Labels that indicate importance:
- `Priority::Critical` - Broken functionality, needs immediate fix
- `Priority::High` - Important, should be addressed soon
- `Priority::Medium` - Normal priority
- `Priority::Low` - Nice to have, low urgency

### Area Labels (Where)

Labels that indicate affected code area:
- `Area::Frontend` - UI/client-side code
- `Area::Backend` - Server/API code
- `Area::Design` - Visual design work
- `Area::Infrastructure` - DevOps/deployment
- `Area::Testing` - Test-related work

### Special Labels

- `good first issue` - Good for new contributors
- `help wanted` - Community assistance requested
- `breaking change` - Breaks backward compatibility
- `accessibility` - Accessibility improvements

**Templates apply some labels automatically, but you may need to add others manually.**

## Milestone Strategy

We use milestones to organize and schedule work:

### How Milestones Work

- **Current Version** (e.g., `v1.0`) - Actively being developed
- **Version Planning** (e.g., `v1.x`) - Planned for future v1 releases
- **Future Release** - Nice-to-have features, no timeline yet

### For Contributors

When you create an issue:
- It's initially unassigned to a milestone
- A maintainer will assign it to a milestone during triage
- `Future Release` = under consideration but not scheduled
- `v1.x` or `v2.x` = planned for that major version
- `v1.0`, `v1.1`, etc. = scheduled for that specific release

**You don't need to assign milestones** - maintainers will handle this.

### For Maintainers

- Assign issues to specific versions when scheduled
- Use `vX.x` for planned but not yet scheduled features
- Use `Future Release` for community requests
- Create patch milestones (v1.0.1) only when needed
